-- Object Detection:
	look at the surroundings to see where a pile of trash is located
	approach the pile
	scan the pile
	if objects of interest exist, mark their location in 3d space


Color different groups of objects different colors
	-- call this whole procedure every half a second


Graph data unit: Original pixel coordinates
				 Maximum of 2 edges
				 Orientation of the edges (like the chain code)
For every pixel we create a 3x3 matrix, with the center representing the pixel
How do we estimate slope?
				-- Use the original pixel coordinates
