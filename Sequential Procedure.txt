This sequence of procedures is designed to describe step by step the actions that are 
	to be performed to generate a Contour Accessebility Map (CAM).

1) Intake a depth frame every //3rd// frame and do:
	- Send the depth frame to be extracted and possibly compressed
		- Remove the red noise if necessary
	- Create a color representation of the grayscale depth information
	- Create point cloud array which will have all the real 3D coordinates
		of each pixel
	- Create a contour map
	- Digitize the contour map
2) Every //2 seconds// do:
	- Average out the contour maps if necessary
	- Downsize the digitized contour map if possible
		- Remove holes if necessary
	- Conduct region filling
		- Create a ragged 2D array which has all the Regions Edge Chain Codes (RECC)
	- Conduct edge simplification where the RECC will be used
		- The end result needs to be a graph; this is the Intermediate Contour
			 Graph Representation (ICoGR)
	- Conduct gulf removal through the use of ICoGR for each region
		- Connect verticees that are closer than a threshold distance
			- This threshold distance should be close to the dimention of the vehicle
		- Find the shortest cycle in terms of edge numbers and output that as the actual 
			graphical representation of a particular region
	- We have successfully generated a Contour Graph Representation (CoGR) for a field 
		of view of 70 degrees

3) The next steps are to be thought about. They can include the following:
	- Find an accessible opening on one of the locations that happen to be on the edge of the 
		field of view
		- Make the vehicle move to that location and redo step 1 from above
		- Combine the two fields of view into one general contour map
			- We need to work on the algorithm for movement of the vehicle
	- Rotate the vehicle to either left or right and combine the CoGR's together
	- Insert another layer of information over the CoGR. This will be demarkations of areas that are
		simply not accessible due to close proximities of different regions
